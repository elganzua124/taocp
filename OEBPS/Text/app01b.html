  <p><a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02ex_2_7_1" id="ch02ex_2_7_1a">1</a>. ${\tt INFO(T)}=A$, ${\tt INFO(RLINK(T))}=C$, etc.; the answer is <em>H</em>.</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02ex_2_7_2" id="ch02ex_2_7_2a">2</a>. Preorder: 1245367; symmetric order: 4251637; postorder: 4526731.</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02ex_2_7_3" id="ch02ex_2_7_3a">3</a>. The statement is true; notice, for example, that nodes 4, 5, 6, 7 always appear in this order in <a href="../Text/app01b.html#ch02ex_2_7_2a">exercise 2</a>. The result is immediately proved by induction on the size of the binary tree.</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02ex_2_7_4" id="ch02ex_2_7_4a">4</a>. It is the reverse of postorder. (This is easily proved by induction.)</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02ex_2_7_5" id="ch02ex_2_7_5a">5</a>. In the tree of <a href="../Text/app01b.html#ch02ex_2_7_2a">exercise 2</a>, for example, preorder is 1, 10, 100, 101, 11, 110, 111, using binary notation (which is in this case equivalent to the Dewey system). The strings of digits have been sorted, like words in a dictionary.</p>

  <p class="indent">In general, the nodes will be listed in preorder if they are sorted lexicographically from left to right, with “blank” &lt; 0 &lt; 1. The nodes will be listed in postorder if they are sorted lexicographically with 0 &lt; 1 &lt; “blank”. For inorder, use 0 &lt; “blank” &lt; 1.</p>

  <p class="indent">(Moreover, if we imagine the blanks at the left and treat the Dewey labels as ordinary binary numbers, we get <em>level order</em>; see <a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02lev2sec9">2.3.3</a>–(<a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02eq-lev2sec9-8">8</a>).)</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02ex_2_7_6" id="ch02ex_2_7_6a">6</a>. The fact that $p_1p_2\ldots p_n$ is obtainable with a stack is readily proved by induction on <em>n</em>, or in fact we may observe that <a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02alg-lev2sec7-T">Algorithm T</a> does precisely what is required in its stack actions. (The corresponding sequence of S’s and X’s, as in <a href="../Text/ch02.html#ch02ex_2_1_3">exercise 2.2.1–3</a>, is the same as the sequence of 1s and 2s as subscripts in double order; see <a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02ex_2_7_18">exercise 18</a>.)</p>

  <p class="indent">Conversely, if $p_1p_2\ldots p_n$ is obtainable with a stack and if $p_k=1$, then $p_1\ldots p_{k-1}$ is a permutation of $\{2,\ldots,k\}$ and $p_{k+1}\ldots p_n$ is a permutation of $\{k+1,\ldots,n\}$; these are the permutations corresponding to the left and right subtrees, and both are obtainable with a stack. The proof now proceeds by induction.</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02ex_2_7_7" id="ch02ex_2_7_7a">7</a>. From the preorder, the root is known; then from the inorder, we know the left subtree and the right subtree; and in fact we know the preorder and inorder of the nodes in the latter subtrees. Hence the tree is readily constructed (and indeed it is quite amusing to construct a simple algorithm that links the tree together in the normal fashion, starting with the nodes linked together in preorder in <code>LLINK</code> and in inorder in <code>RLINK</code>). Similarly, postorder and inorder together characterize the structure. But preorder and postorder do not; there are two binary trees having $AB$ as preorder and $BA$ as postorder. If all nonterminal nodes of a binary tree have <em>both</em> branches nonempty, its structure <em>is</em> characterized by preorder and postorder.</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02ex_2_7_8" id="ch02ex_2_7_8a">8</a>. (a) Binary trees with all $\tt LLINK\rm s$ null. (b) Binary trees with zero or one nodes. (c) Binary trees with all $\tt RLINK\rm s$ null.</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02ex_2_7_9" id="ch02ex_2_7_9a">9</a>. <code>T1</code> once, <code>T2</code> $2n{+}1$ times, <code>T3</code> <em>n</em> times, <code>T4</code> $n{+}1$ times, <code>T5</code> <em>n</em> times. These counts can be derived by induction or by Kirchhoff’s law, or by examining <a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02a_pro_t">Program T</a>.</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02ex_2_7_10" id="ch02ex_2_7_10a">10</a>. A binary tree with all $\tt RLINK\rm s$ null will cause all <em>n</em> node addresses to be put in the stack before any are removed.</p>

  <p><a id="page_565"></a><a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02ex_2_7_11" id="ch02ex_2_7_11a">11</a>. Let $a_{nk}$ be the number of binary trees with <em>n</em> nodes for which the stack in <a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02alg-lev2sec7-T">Algorithm T</a> never contains more than <em>k</em> items. If $g_k(z)=∑_na_{nk}z^n$, we find $g_1(z)=1/(1-z)$, $g_2(z)=1/(1-z/(1-z))=(1-z)/(1-2z),\ldots,g_k(z)=1/(1-zg_{k-1}(z))=q_{k-1}(z)/q_k(z)$ where $q_{-1}(z)=q_0(z)=1,q_{k+1}(z)=q_k(z)-zq_{k-1}(z)$; hence $g_k(z)=(f_1(z)^{k+1}-f_2(z)^{k+1})/(f_1(z)^{k+2}-f_2(z)^{k+2})$ where $f_j(z)=\frac12{\left(1\pm\sqrt{1-4z}\right)}$. It can now be shown that $a_{nk}=[u^n](1-u)(1+u)^{2n}(1-u^{k+1})/(1-u^{k+2})$; hence $s_n=∑_{k\ge1}k(a_{nk}-a_{n(k-1)})$ is $[u^{n+1}](1-u)^2(1+u)^{2n}∑_{j\ge1}u^j/(1-u^j)$, minus $a_{nn}$. The technique of exercise 5.2.2–52 now yields the asymptotic series</p>

  <p class="center">$s_n/a_{nn}=\sqrt{\pi n}-\frac32-\frac{13}{24}\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{n}}+\frac{1}{2n}+O\left(n^{-3/2}\right)$</p>

  <p class="indent">When the binary tree represents a forest as described in <a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02lev2sec8">Section 2.3.2</a>, the quantity analyzed here is the <em>height</em> of that forest (the furthest distance between a node and a root, plus one). Generalizations to many other varieties of trees have been obtained by Flajolet and Odlyzko [<em>j. Computer and System Sci.</em> <strong>25</strong> (1982), 171–213]; the asymptotic distribution of heights, both near the mean and far away, was subsequently analyzed by Flajolet, Gao, Odlyzko, and Richmond [<em>Combinatorics, Probability, and Computing</em> <strong>2</strong> (1993), 145–156].</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02ex_2_7_12" id="ch02ex_2_7_12a">12</a>. Visit $\tt NODE(P)$ between steps T2 and T3, instead of in step T5. For the proof, demonstrate the validity of the statement “<em>Starting at step T2 with $\ldots$ original value</em> ${\tt A[}1{\tt]\ldots A[}m\tt]$,” essentially as in the text.</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02ex_2_7_13" id="ch02ex_2_7_13a">13</a>. (Solution by S. Araújo, 1976.) Let steps T1 through T4 be unchanged, except that a new variable <code>Q</code> is initialized to <em>Λ</em> in step T1′; <code>Q</code> will point to the last node visited, if any. Step T5 becomes two steps:</p>

  <p class="uln-indentC"><strong>T5′.</strong> [Right branch done?] If ${\tt RLINK(P)}=\varLambda$ or ${\tt RLINK(P)}=\tt Q$, go on to T6; otherwise set $\tt A\Leftarrow P$, $\tt P←RLINK(P)$ and return to T2′.</p>

  <p class="uln-indentC"><strong>T6′.</strong> [Visit <code>P</code>.] Visit $\tt NODE(P)$, set $\tt Q←P$, and return to T4′.</p>

  <p>A similar proof applies. (Steps T4′ and T5′ can be streamlined so that nodes are not taken off the stack and immediately reinserted.)</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02ex_2_7_14" id="ch02ex_2_7_14a">14</a>. By induction, there are always exactly <em>n</em> + 1 <em>Λ</em> links (counting <code>T</code> when it is null). There are <em>n</em> nonnull links, counting <code>T</code>, so the remark in the text about the majority of null links is justified.</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02ex_2_7_15" id="ch02ex_2_7_15a">15</a>. There is a thread <code>LLINK</code> or <code>RLINK</code> pointing to a node if and only if it has a nonempty right or left subtree, respectively. (See <a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02fig24">Fig. 24</a>.)</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02ex_2_7_16" id="ch02ex_2_7_16a">16</a>. If ${\tt LTAG(Q)}=0$, <code>Q*</code> is $\tt LLINK(Q)$; thus <code>Q*</code> is one step down and to the left. Otherwise <code>Q*</code> is obtained by going upwards in the tree (if necessary) repeatedly until the first time it is possible to go down to the right without retracing steps; typical examples are the trips from <code>P</code> to <code>P*</code> and from <code>Q</code> to <code>Q*</code> in the following tree:</p>

  <div class="image"><img src="../Images/565fig01.png" /></div>

  <p><a id="page_566"></a><a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02ex_2_7_17" id="ch02ex_2_7_17a">17</a>. If ${\tt LTAG(P)}=0$, set $\tt Q←LLINK(P)$ and terminate. Otherwise set $\tt Q←P$, then set $\tt Q←RLINK(Q)$ zero or more times until finding ${\tt RTAG(Q)}=0$; finally set $\tt Q←RLINK(Q)$ once more.</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02ex_2_7_18" id="ch02ex_2_7_18a">18</a>. Modify <a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02alg-lev2sec7-T">Algorithm T</a> by inserting a step T2.5, “Visit $\tt NODE(P)$ the first time”; in step T5, we are visiting $\tt NODE(P)$ the second time.</p>

  <p class="indent">Given a threaded tree the traversal is extremely simple:</p>

  <p class="uln-indent1">$({\tt P},1)^\varDelta=({\tt LLINK(P)},1)$ if ${\tt LTAG(P)}=0$, otherwise $({\tt P},2)$;</p>

  <p class="uln-indent1">$({\tt P},2)^\varDelta=({\tt RLINK(P)},1)$ if ${\tt RTAG(P)}=0$, otherwise $({\tt RLINK(P)},2)$.</p>

  <p>In each case, we move at most one step in the tree; in practice, therefore, double order and the values of <em>d</em> and <em>e</em> are embedded in a program and not explicitly mentioned.</p>

  <p class="indent">Suppressing all the first visits gives us precisely <a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02alg-lev2sec7-T">Algorithms T</a> and <a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02alg-lev2sec6-S">S</a>; suppressing all the second visits gives us the solutions to <a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02ex_2_7_12">exercises 12</a> and <a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02ex_2_7_17">17</a>.</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02ex_2_7_19" id="ch02ex_2_7_19a">19</a>. The basic idea is to start by finding the parent <code>Q</code> of <code>P</code>. Then if $\tt P\neq LLINK(Q)$ we have ${\tt P\sharp}=\tt Q$; otherwise we can find $\tt P\sharp$ by repeatedly setting $\tt Q←Q\$$ zero or more times until ${\tt RTAG(Q)}=1$. (See, for example, <code>P</code> and $\tt P\sharp$ in the tree shown.)</p>

  <div class="image"><img src="../Images/566fig01.png" /></div>

  <p class="indent">There is no efficient algorithm to find the parent of <code>P</code> in a general right-threaded tree, since a degenerate right-threaded tree in which all left links are null is essentially a circular list in which the links go the wrong way. Therefore we cannot traverse a right-threaded tree in postorder with the same efficiency as the stack method of <a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02ex_2_7_13">exercise 13</a>, if we keep no history of how we have reached the current node <code>P</code>.</p>

  <p class="indent">But if the tree is threaded in both directions, we <em>can</em> find $\tt P\rm\unicode{39}s$ parent efficiently:</p>

  <p class="uln-indentC"><strong>F1.</strong> Set $\tt Q←P$ and $\tt R←P$.</p>

  <p class="uln-indentC"><strong>F2.</strong> If ${\tt LTAG(Q)}={\tt RTAG(R)}=0$, set $\tt Q←LLINK(Q)$ and $\tt R←RLINK(R)$ and repeat this step. Otherwise go to F4 if ${\tt RTAG(R)}=1$.</p>

  <p class="uln-indentC"><strong>F3.</strong> Set $\tt Q←LLINK(Q)$, and terminate if $\tt P=RLINK(Q)$. Otherwise set $\tt R←RLINK(R)$ zero or more times until ${\tt RTAG(R)}=1$, then set $\tt Q←RLINK(R)$ and terminate.</p>

  <p class="uln-indentC"><strong>F4.</strong> Set $\tt R←RLINK(R)$, and terminate with $\tt Q←R$ if $\tt P=LLINK(R)$. Otherwise set $\tt Q←LLINK(Q)$ zero or more times until ${\tt LTAG(Q)}=1$, then set $\tt Q←LLINK(Q)$ and terminate. <span class="middle"><img src="../Images/box.png" /></span></p>

  <p>The average running time of <a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02alg-lev2sec9-F">Algorithm F</a> is $O(1)$ when <code>P</code> is a random node of the tree. For if we count only the steps $\tt Q←LLINK(Q)$ when <code>P</code> is a right child, or only the steps $\tt R←RLINK(R)$ when <code>P</code> is a left child, each link is traversed for exactly one node <code>P</code>.</p>

  <p>with appropriate changes in lines 10 and 11, the running time goes down from $(30n+a+4)u$ to $(27a+6n-22)u$. (This same device would reduce the running time of <a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02a_pro_t">Program T</a> to $(12a+6n-7)u$, which is a slight improvement, if we set $a=(n+1)/2.)$</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02ex_2_7_21" id="ch02ex_2_7_21a">21</a>. The following solution by Joseph M. Morris [<em>Inf. Proc. Letters</em> <strong>9</strong> (1979), 197–200] traverses also in preorder (see <a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02ex_2_7_18">exercise 18</a>).</p>

  <p class="uln-indentC"><strong>U1.</strong> [Initialize.] Set $\tt P←T$ and $\tt R←\varLambda$.</p>

  <p class="uln-indentC"><strong>U2.</strong> [Done?] If ${\tt P}=\varLambda$, the algorithm terminates.</p>

  <p class="uln-indentC"><strong>U3.</strong> [Look left.] Set $\tt Q←LLINK(P)$. If ${\tt Q}=\varLambda$, visit $\tt NODE(P)$ in preorder and go to U6.</p>

  <p class="uln-indentC"><strong>U4.</strong> [Search for thread.] Set $\tt Q←RLINK(Q)$ zero or more times until either <code>Q</code> = <code>R</code> or ${\tt RLINK(Q)}=\varLambda$.</p>

  <p class="uln-indentC"><strong>U5.</strong> [Insert or remove thread.] If $\tt Q\neq R$, set $\tt RLINK(Q)←P$ and go to U8. Otherwise set $\tt RLINK(Q)←\varLambda$ (it had been changed temporarily to <code>P</code>, but we’ve now traversed $\tt P\rm\unicode{39}s$ left subtree).</p>

  <p class="uln-indentC"><strong>U6.</strong> [Inorder visit.] Visit $\tt NODE(P)$ in inorder.</p>

  <p class="uln-indentC"><strong>U7.</strong> [Go to right or up.] Set $\tt R←P$, $\tt P←RLINK(P)$, and return to U2.</p>

  <p class="uln-indentC"><strong>U8.</strong> [Preorder visit.] Visit $\tt NODE(P)$ in preorder.</p>

  <p class="uln-indentC"><strong>U9.</strong> [Go to left.] Set $\tt P←LLINK(P)$ and return to step U3. <span class="middle"><img src="../Images/box.png" /></span></p>

  <p>Morris also suggested a slightly more complicated way to traverse in postorder.</p>

  <p class="indent">A completely different solution was found by J. M. Robson [<em>Inf. Proc. Letters</em> <strong>2</strong> (1973), 12–14]. Let’s say that a node is “full” if its <code>LLINK</code> and <code>RLINK</code> are nonnull, “empty” if its <code>LLINK</code> and <code>RLINK</code> are both empty. Robson found a way to maintain a stack of pointers to the full nodes whose right subtrees are being visited, using the link fields in empty nodes!</p>

  <p class="indent">Yet another way to avoid an auxiliary stack was discovered independently by G. Lindstrom and B. Dwyer, <em>Inf. Proc. Letters</em> <strong>2</strong> (1973), 47–51, 143–145. Their algorithm traverses in <em>triple order</em>—it visits every node exactly three times, once in each of preorder, inorder, and postorder—but it does not know which of the three is currently being done.</p>

  <p class="uln-indentC"><strong>W1.</strong> [Initialize.] Set $\tt P←T$ and $\tt Q←S$, where <code>S</code> is a sentinel value — any number that is known to be different from any link in the tree (e.g., $-1$).</p>

  <p class="uln-indentC"><strong>W2.</strong> [Bypass null.] If ${\tt P}=\varLambda$, set $\tt P←Q$ and $\tt Q←\varLambda$.</p>

  <p class="uln-indentC"><strong>W3.</strong> [Done?] If <code>P</code> = <code>S</code>, terminate the algorithm. (We will have <code>Q</code> = <code>T</code> at termination.)</p>

  <p class="uln-indentC" id="page_568"><strong>W4.</strong> [Visit.] Visit $\tt NODE(P)$.</p>

  <p class="uln-indentC"><strong>W5.</strong> [Rotate.] Set $\tt R←LLINK(P)$, $\tt LLINK(P)←RLINK(P)$, $\tt RLINK(P)←Q$, $\tt Q←P$, $\tt P←R$, and return to W2. <span class="middle"><img src="../Images/box.png" /></span></p>

  <p>Correctness follows from the fact that if we start at W2 with <code>P</code> pointing to the root of a binary tree <code>T</code> and <code>Q</code> pointing to <code>X</code>, where <code>X</code> is not a link in that tree, the algorithm will traverse the tree in triple order and reach step W3 with <code>P</code> = <code>X</code> and <code>Q</code> = <code>T</code>.</p>

  <p class="indent">If $\alpha({\tt T})=x_1x_2\ldots x_{3n}$ is the resulting sequence of nodes in triple order, we have $\alpha({\tt T})={\tt T}\;\alpha({\tt LLINK(T)})\;{\tt T}\;\alpha({\tt RLINK(T)})\tt\;T$. Therefore, as Lindstrom observed, the three subsequences $x_1x_4\ldots x_{3n-2},x_2x_5\ldots x_{3n-1},x_3x_6\ldots x_{3n}$ each include every tree node just once. (Since $x_{j+1}$ is either the parent or child of $x_j$, these subsequences visit the nodes in such a way that each is at most three links away from its predecessor. Section 7.2.1.6 describes a general traversal scheme called <em>prepostorder</em> that has this property not only for binary trees but for trees in general.)</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02ex_2_7_22" id="ch02ex_2_7_22a">22</a>. This program uses the conventions of <a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02a_pro_t">Programs T</a> and <a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02a_pro_s">S</a>, with <code>Q</code> in rI6 and/or rI4. The old-fashioned <code>MIX</code> computer is not good at comparing index registers for equality, so variable <code>R</code> is omitted and the test “<code>Q</code> = <code>R</code>” is changed to “${\tt RLINK(Q)}=\tt P$”.</p>

  <p>The total running time is $21n+6a-3-14b$, where <em>n</em> is the number of nodes, <em>a</em> is the number of null <code>RLINK</code>s (hence $a-1$ is the number of nonnull <code>LLINK</code>s), and <em>b</em> is the number of nodes on the tree’s “right spine” <code>T</code>, $\tt RLINK(T)$, $\tt RLINK(RLINK(T))$, etc.</p>

  <p class="indent">(A more efficient algorithm for the last case can be used if we know a node <code>F</code> such that $\tt P=LLINK(F)$ or $\tt P=RLINK(F)$; assuming the latter, for example, we could set $\tt INFO(P)\leftrightarrow INFO(Q)$, $\tt RLINK(F)←Q$, $\tt LLINK(Q)←P$, $\tt RLINKT(Q)←RLINKT(P)$, $\tt RLINK(P)←Q$, ${\tt RTAG(P)}←1$. This takes a fixed amount of time, but it is generally not recommended because it switches nodes around in memory.)</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02ex_2_7_25" id="ch02ex_2_7_25a">25</a>. We first prove (b), by induction on the number of nodes in <em>T</em>, and similarly (c). Now (a) breaks into several cases; write $T\preceq_1T'$ if (i) holds, $T\preceq_2T'$ if (ii) holds, etc. Then $T\preceq_1T'$ and $T'\preceq T''$ implies $T\preceq_1T''$; $T\preceq_2T'$ and $T'\preceq T''$ implies $T\preceq_2T''$; and the remaining two cases are treated by proving (a) by induction on the number of nodes in <em>T</em>.</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02ex_2_7_26" id="ch02ex_2_7_26a">26</a>.

If <em>u</em> is another node of the first tree, <em>υ</em> must be also, since <em>u</em> follows <em>υ</em> in postorder; so induction applies.

If $\tt NODE(P)$ is a binary operator, pointers to its two operands are ${\tt P1}=\tt LLINK(P)$ and ${\tt P2}={\tt RLINK(P1)}=\tt\$P$. <a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02alg-lev2sec8-D">Algorithm D</a> makes use of the fact that ${\tt P2\$}=\tt P$, so that $\tt RLINK(P1)$ may be changed to <code>Q1</code>, a pointer to the derivative of $\tt NODE(P1)$; then $\tt RLINK(P1)$ is reset later in step D3. For ternary operations, we would have, say, ${\tt P1}=\tt LLINK(P)$, ${\tt P2}=\tt RLINK(P1)$, ${\tt P3}={\tt RLINK(P2)}=\tt\$P$, so it is difficult to generalize the binary trick. After computing the derivative <code>Q1</code>, we could set $\tt RLINK(P1)←Q1$ temporarily, and then after computing the next derivative <code>Q2</code> we could set $\tt RLINK(Q2)←Q1$ and $\tt RLINK(P2)←Q2$ and reset $\tt RLINK(P1)←P2$.

From the definition it follows immediately that the relation is transitive; that is, if $T\subseteq T'$ and $T'\subseteq T''$ then $T\subseteq T''$.

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_2_9_1" id="ch02ex_2_9_1a">1</a>. Yes, we can reconstruct them just as (<a href="../Text/ch02.html#ch02eq-lev2sec3-3">3</a>) is deduced from (<a href="../Text/ch02.html#ch02eq-lev2sec3-4">4</a>), but interchanging <code>LTAG</code> and <code>RTAG</code>, <code>LLINK</code> and <code>RLINK</code>, and using a queue instead of a stack.</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_2_9_2" id="ch02ex_2_9_2a">2</a>. Make the following changes in <a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02alg-lev2sec9-F">Algorithm F</a>: Step F1, change to “last node of the forest in preorder.” Step F2, change “$f(x_d),\ldots,f(x_1)$” to “$f(x_1),\ldots,f(x_d)$” in two places. Step F4, “If <code>P</code> is the first node in preorder, terminate the algorithm. (Then the stack contains $f({\rm root}(T_1)),\ldots,f({\rm root}(T_m))$, from top to bottom, where $T_1,\ldots,T_m$ are the trees of the given forest, from left to right.) Otherwise set <code>P</code> to its predecessor in preorder (${\tt P←P}-c$ in the given representation), and return to F2.”</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_2_9_3" id="ch02ex_2_9_3a">3</a>. In step D1, also set $\tt S←\varLambda$. (<code>S</code> is a link variable that links to the top of the stack.) Step D2 becomes, for example, “If $\tt NODE(P)$ denotes a unary operator, set $\tt Q←S$, $\tt S←RLINK(Q)$, ${\tt P1←LLINK(P)}$; if it denotes a binary operator, set $\tt Q←S$, $\tt Q1←RLINK(Q)$, ${\tt S←RLINK(Q1)}$, $\tt P1←LLINK(P)$, $\tt P2←RLINK(P1)$. Then perform $\tt DIFF[TYPE(P)]$.” Step D3 becomes “Set $\tt RLINK(Q)←S$, $\tt S←Q$.” Step D4 becomes “Set $\tt P←P\$$.” The operation $\tt LLINK(DY)←Q$ may be avoided in step D5 if we assume that $\tt S≡LLINK(DY)$. This technique clearly generalizes to ternary and higher-order operators.</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_2_9_4" id="ch02ex_2_9_4a">4</a>. A representation like (<a href="../Text/ch02.html#ch02eq-lev2sec3-10">10</a>) takes $n-m$ <code>LLINK</code>s and $n+(n-m)$ <code>RLINK</code>s. The difference in total number of links is $n-2m$ between the two forms of representation. Arrangement (<a href="../Text/ch02.html#ch02eq-lev2sec3-10">10</a>) is superior when the <code>LLINK</code> and <code>INFO</code> fields require about the same amount of space in a node and when <em>m</em> is rather large, namely when the nonterminal nodes have rather large degrees.</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_2_9_5" id="ch02ex_2_9_5a">5</a>. It would certainly be silly to include threaded <code>RLINK</code>s, since an <code>RLINK</code> thread just points to $\tt PARENT$ anyway. Threaded <code>LLINK</code>s as in <a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02lev2sec8">2.3.2</a>–(<a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02eq-lev2sec8-4">4</a>) would be useful if it is necessary to move leftward in the tree, for example if we wanted to traverse a tree in reverse postorder, or in family order; but these operations are not significantly harder without threaded <code>LLINK</code>s unless the nodes tend to have very high degrees.</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_2_9_10" id="ch02ex_2_9_10a">10</a>. One idea is to set $\tt PARENT$ of each <em>root</em> node to the negative of the number of nodes in its tree (these values being easily kept up to date); then if $|{\tt PARENT[}j{\tt]}|\gt|{\tt PARENT[}k{\tt]}|$ in step E4, the roles of <em>j</em> and <em>k</em> are interchanged. This technique (due to M. D. McIlroy) ensures that each operation takes $O(\log n)$ steps.</p>

  <p class="indent">For still more speed, we can use the following suggestion due to Alan Tritter: In step E4, set ${\tt PARENT[}x{\tt]}←k$ for all values $x\neq k$ that were encountered in step E3. This makes an extra pass up the trees, but it collapses them so that future searches are faster. (See Section 7.4.1.)</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_2_9_11" id="ch02ex_2_9_11a">11</a>. It suffices to define the transformation that is done for each input $({\tt P},j,{\tt Q},k)$:</p>

  <p class="uln-indentC"><strong>T1.</strong> If $\tt PARENT(P)\neq\varLambda$, set $j←j+\tt DELTA(P)$, $\tt P←PARENT(P)$, and repeat this step.</p>

  <p class="uln-indentC"><strong>T2.</strong> If $\tt PARENT(Q)\neq\varLambda$, set $k←k+\tt DELTA(Q)$, $\tt Q←PARENT(Q)$, and repeat this step.</p>

  <p class="uln-indentC"><strong>T3.</strong> If <code>P</code> = <code>Q</code>, check that $j=k$ (otherwise the input erroneously contains contradictory equivalences).

  <p><em>Note:</em> It is possible to allow the ${\tt ARRAY\;X[}l:u\tt]$ declarations to occur intermixed with equivalences, or to allow assignment of certain addresses of variables before others are equivalenced to them, etc., under suitable conditions that are not difficult to understand. For further development of this algorithm, see <em>CACM</em> <strong>7</strong> (1964), 301–303, 506.</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_2_9_12" id="ch02ex_2_9_12a">12</a>. (a) Yes. (If this condition is not required, it would be possible to avoid the loops on <code>S</code> that appear in steps A2 and A9.) (b) Yes.</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_2_9_13" id="ch02ex_2_9_13a">13</a>. The crucial fact is that the <code>UP</code> chain leading upward from <code>P</code> always mentions the same variables and the same exponents for these variables as the <code>UP</code> chain leading upward from <code>Q</code>, except that the latter chain may include additional steps for variables with exponent zero. (This condition holds throughout most of the algorithm, except during the execution of steps A9 and A10.) Now we get to step A8 either from A3 or from A10, and in each case it was verified that ${\tt EXP(Q)}\neq0$. Therefore ${\tt EXP(P)}\neq0$, and in particular it follows that $\tt P\neq\varLambda$, $\tt Q\neq\varLambda$, $\tt UP(P)\neq\varLambda$, $\tt UP(Q)\neq\varLambda$; the result stated in the exercise now follows. Thus the proof depends on showing that the <code>UP</code> chain condition stated above is preserved by the actions of the algorithm.</p>

  <p><a id="page_577"></a><a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_2_9_16" id="ch02ex_2_9_16a">16</a>. We prove (by induction on the number of nodes in a <em>single tree <em>T</em></em>) that if <code>P</code> is a pointer to <em>T</em>, and if the stack is initially empty, steps F2 through F4 will end with the single value $f({\rm root}(T))$ on the stack. This is true for <em>n</em> = 1. If $n\gt1$, there are $0\lt d={\tt DEGREE}({\rm root}(T))$ subtrees $T_1,\ldots,T_d$; by induction and the nature of a stack, and since postorder consists of $T_1,\ldots,T_d$ followed by ${\rm root}(T)$, the algorithm computes $f(T_1),\ldots,f(T_d)$, and then $f({\rm root}(T))$, as desired. The validity of <a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02alg-lev2sec9-F">Algorithm F</a> for forests follows.</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_2_9_17" id="ch02ex_2_9_17a">17</a>. <strong>G1.</strong> Set the stack empty, and let <code>P</code> point to the root of the tree (the last node in postorder). Evaluate $f({\tt NODE(P)})$.</p>

  <p class="uln-indentC"><strong>G3.</strong> If <code>P</code> is the first node in postorder, terminate the algorithm. Otherwise set <code>P</code> to its predecessor in postorder (this would be simply ${\tt P←P}-c$ in (<a href="../Text/ch02.html#ch02eq-lev2sec3-9">9</a>)).</p>

  <p class="uln-indentC"><strong>G4.</strong> Evaluate $f({\tt NODE(P)})$ using the value at the top of the stack, which is equal to $f({\tt NODE(PARENT(P))})$. Pop this value off the stack, and return to G2. <span class="middle"><img src="../Images/box.png" /></span></p>

  <p><em>Note:</em> An algorithm analogous to this one can be based on preorder instead of postorder as in <a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_2_9_2">exercise 2</a>. In fact, family order or level order could be used; in the latter case we would use a queue instead of a stack.</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_2_9_18" id="ch02ex_2_9_18a">18</a>. The $\tt INFO1$ and <code>RLINK</code> tables, together with the suggestion for computing <code>LTAG</code> in the text, give us the equivalent of a binary tree represented in the usual manner. The idea is to traverse this tree in postorder, counting degrees as we go:</p>

  <p class="uln-indentC"><strong>P1.</strong> Let <code>R</code>, <code>D</code>, and <code>I</code> be stacks that are initially empty; then set ${\tt R}\Leftarrow n+1$, ${\tt D}\Leftarrow 0$, $j←0$, $k←0$.</p>

  <p class="uln-indentC"><strong>P3.</strong> If <code>I</code> is empty, terminate the algorithm; otherwise set $i\Leftarrow\tt I$, $k←k+1$, ${\tt INFO2[}k{\tt]←INFO1[}i\tt]$, ${\tt DEGREE[}k{\tt]\Leftarrow D}$.</p>

  <p class="uln-indentC"><strong>P4.</strong> If ${\tt RLINK[}i{\tt]}=0$, go to P3; otherwise delete the top of <code>R</code> (which will equal ${\tt RLINK[}i\tt]$).</p>

  <p class="uln-indentC"><strong>P5.</strong> Set ${\rm top}({\tt D})←{\rm top}({\tt D})+1$, $j←j+1$, ${\tt I}\Leftarrow j$, ${\tt D}\Leftarrow 0$, and if ${\tt RLINK[}j{\tt]}\neq0$ set ${\tt R}\Leftarrow{\tt RLINK[}j\tt]$. Go to P2. <span class="middle"><img src="../Images/box.png" /></span></p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_2_9_19" id="ch02ex_2_9_19a">19</a>. (a) This property is equivalent to saying that <code>SCOPE</code> links do not cross each other.</p>

  <p class="indenthangingA">(b) The first tree of the forest contains $d_1+1$ elements, and we can proceed by induction.</p>

  <p class="indenthangingA">(c) The condition of (a) is preserved when we take minima.</p>

  <p class="indent"><em>Notes:</em> By <a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02ex_2_8_20">exercise 2.3.2–20</a>, it follows that $d_1d_2\ldots d_n$ can also be interpreted in terms of inversions: If the $k\rm th$ node in postorder is the $p_k\rm th$ node in preorder, then $d_k$ is the number of elements $\gt k$ that appear to the left of <em>k</em> in $p_1p_2\ldots p_n$.</p>

  <p class="indent">A similar scheme, in which we list the number of descendants of each node in <em>postorder</em> of the forest, leads to sequences of numbers $c_1c_2\ldots c_n$ characterized by the properties (i) $0≤c_k\lt k$ and (ii) $k\ge j\ge k-c_k$ implies $j-c_j\ge k-c_k$. Algorithms based on such sequences have been investigated by J. M. Pallo, <em>Comp. J.</em> <strong>29</strong> (1986), 171–175. Notice that $c_k$ is the size of the left subtree of the $k\rm th$ node in symmetric order of the corresponding binary tree. We can also interpret $d_k$ as the size of the <em>right</em> subtree of the $k\rm th$ node in symmetric order of a suitable binary tree, namely the binary tree that corresponds to the given forest by the dual method of <a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02ex_2_8_5">exercise 2.3.2–5</a>.</p>

  <p class="indent">The relation $d_k≤d'_k$ for $1≤k≤n$ defines an interesting lattice ordering of forests and binary trees, first introduced in another way by D. Tamari [Thèse (Paris, 1951)]; see exercise 6.2.3–32.</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_3_1_3" id="ch02ex_3_1_3a">3</a>. (The fundamental path traverses $e_3$ and $e_4$ once, but cycle $C_2$ traverses them $-1$ times, giving a net total of zero.)

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_3_1_4" id="ch02ex_3_1_4a">4</a>. If not, let $G''$ be the subgraph of $G'$ obtained by deleting each edge $e_j$ for which $E_j=0$. Then $G''$ is a finite graph that has no cycles and at least one edge, so by the proof of <a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02b_the_a">Theorem A</a> there is at least one vertex, <em>V</em>, that is adjacent to exactly one other vertex, $V'$. Let $e_j$ be the edge joining <em>V</em> to $V'$; then Kirchhoff’s equation (<a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02eq-lev3sec1-1">1</a>) at vertex <em>V</em> is $E_j=0$, contradicting the definition of $G''$.</p>

  <em>Note:</em> In this case it is also possible to solve for $E_2,E_5,\ldots,E_{25}$ in terms of $A,B,\ldots,S$; hence there are nine independent solutions, explaining why we eliminated six variables in Eq. <a href="../Text/ch01b.html#ch01lev2sec14">1.3.3</a>–(<a href="../Text/ch01b.html#ch01eq-lev3sec3-8">8</a>).</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_3_1_6" id="ch02ex_3_1_6a">6</a>. (The following solution is based on the idea that we may print out each edge that does not make a cycle with the preceding edges.) Use <a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02alg-lev2sec9-E">Algorithm 2.3.3E</a>, with each pair $(a_i,b_i)$ representing $a_i≡b_i$ in the notation of that algorithm. The only change is to print $(a_i,b_i)$ if $j\neq k$ in step E4.</p>

  <p class="indent">To show that this algorithm is valid, we must prove that (a) the algorithm prints out no edges that form a cycle, and (b) if <em>G</em> contains at least one free subtree, the algorithm prints out $n-1$ edges. Define $j≡k$ if there exists a path from $V_j$ to $V_k$ or if $j=k$. This is clearly an equivalence relation, and moreover $j≡k$ if and only if this relation can be deduced from the equivalences $a_1≡b_1,\ldots,a_m≡b_m$. Now (a) holds because the algorithm prints out no edges that form a cycle with previously printed edges; (b) is true because ${\tt PARENT[}k{\tt]}=0$ for precisely one <em>k</em> if all vertices are equivalent.</p>

  <p class="indent">A more efficient algorithm can, however, be based on depth-first search; see <a href="../Text/ch02c.html#ch02alg-lev2sec11-A">Algorithm 2.3.5A</a> and Section 7.4.1.</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_3_1_7" id="ch02ex_3_1_7a">7</a>. Fundamental cycles: $C_0=e_0+e_1+e_4+e_9$ (fundamental path is $e_1+e_4+e_9$); $C_5=e_5+e_3+e_2$; $C_6=e_6-e_2+e_4$; $C_7=e_7-e_4-e_3$; $C_8=e_8-e_9-e_4-e_3$. Therefore we find $E_1=1$, $E_2=E_5-E_6$, $E_3=E_5-E_7-E_8$, $E_4=1+E_6-E_7-E_8$, $E_9=1-E_8$.</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_3_1_8" id="ch02ex_3_1_8a">8</a>. Each step in the reduction process combines two arrows $e_i$ and $e_j$ that start at the same box, and it suffices to prove that such steps can be reversed. Thus we are given the value of $e_i+e_j$ after combination, and we must assign consistent values to $e_i$ and $e_j$ before the combination. There are three essentially different situations:</p>

  <div class="image"><img src="../Images/e578_05.png" /></div>

  <p><a id="page_579"></a>Here <em>A</em>, <em>B</em>, and <em>C</em> stand for vertices or supervertices, and the $\alpha\rm\unicode{39}s$ and $\beta\rm\unicode{39}s$ stand for the other given flows besides $e_i+e_j$; these flows may each be distributed among several edges, although only one is shown. In Case 1 ($e_i$ and $e_j$ lead to the same box), we may choose $e_i$ arbitrarily, then $e_j←(e_i+e_j)-e_i$. In Case 2 ($e_i$ and $e_j$ lead to different boxes), we must set $e_i←\beta'-\alpha'$, $e_j←\beta''-\alpha''$. In Case 3 ($e_i$ is a loop but $e_j$ is not), we must set $e_j←\beta'-\alpha'$, $e_i←(e_i+e_j)-e_j$. In each case we have reversed the combination step as desired.</p>

  <p class="indent">The result of this exercise essentially proves that the number of fundamental cycles in the reduced flow chart is the minimum number of vertex flows that must be measured to determine all the others. In the given example, the reduced flow chart reveals that only three vertex flows (e.g., <em>a</em>, <em>c</em>, <em>d</em>) need to be measured, while the original chart of <a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_3_1_7">exercise 7</a> has four independent edge flows. We save one measurement every time Case 1 occurs during the reduction.</p>

  <p class="indent">A similar reduction procedure could be based on combining the arrows flowing <em>into</em> a given box, instead of those flowing out. It can be shown that this would yield the same reduced flow chart, except that the supervertices would contain different names.</p>

  <p class="indent">The construction in this exercise is based on ideas due to Armen Nahapetian and F. Stevenson. For further comments, see A. Nahapetian, <em>Acta Informatica</em> <strong>3</strong> (1973), 37–41; D. E. Knuth and F. Stevenson, <em>BIT</em> <strong>13</strong> (1973), 313–322.</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_3_1_9" id="ch02ex_3_1_9a">9</a>. Each edge from a vertex to itself becomes a “fundamental cycle” all by itself. If there are $k+1$ edges $e,e',\ldots,e^{(k)}$ between vertices <em>V</em> and $V'$, make <em>k</em> fundamental cycles $e'±e,\ldots,e^{(k)}±e$ (choosing + or − according as the edges go in the opposite or the same direction), and then proceed as if only edge <em>e</em> were present.</p>

  <p class="indent">Actually this situation would be much simpler conceptually if we had defined a graph in such a way that multiple edges are allowed between vertices, and edges are allowed from a vertex to itself; paths and cycles would be defined in terms of edges instead of vertices. Such a definition is, in fact, made for directed graphs in <a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02lev3sec2">Section 2.3.4.2</a>.</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_3_1_10" id="ch02ex_3_1_10a">10</a>. If the terminals have all been connected together, the corresponding graph must be connected in the technical sense. A minimum number of wires will involve no cycles, so we must have a free tree. By <a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02b_the_a">Theorem A</a>, a free tree contains $n-1$ wires, and a graph with <em>n</em> vertices and $n-1$ edges is a free tree if and only if it is connected.</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_3_1_11" id="ch02ex_3_1_11a">11</a>. It is sufficient to prove that when $n\gt1$ and $c(n-1,n)$ is the minimum of the $c(i,n)$, there exists at least one minimum cost tree in which $T_{n-1}$ is wired to $T_n$. (For, any minimum cost tree with $n\gt1$ terminals and with $T_{n-1}$ wired to $T_n$ must also be a minimum cost tree with $n-1$ terminals if we regard $T_{n-1}$ and $T_n$ as “common,” using the convention stated in the algorithm.)</p>

  <p class="indent">To prove the statement above, suppose we have a minimum cost tree in which $T_{n-1}$ is not wired to $T_n$. If we add the wire $T_{n-1}\;—\;T_n$ we obtain a cycle, and any of the other wires in that cycle may be removed; removing the other wire touching $T_n$ gives us another tree, whose total cost is not greater than the original, and $T_{n-1}\;—\;T_n$ appears in that tree.</p>

If there is no path from $V_i$ to $V_j$, for some $i\neq j$, then no product of the transpositions will move <em>i</em> to <em>j</em>. So if all permutations are generated, the graph must be connected. Conversely if it is connected, remove edges if necessary until we have a free tree. Then renumber the vertices so that $V_n$ is adjacent to only one other vertex, namely $V_{n-1}$. (See the proof of <a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02b_the_a">Theorem A</a>.) Now the transpositions other than $(n-1 n)$ form a free tree with $n-1$ vertices; so by induction if π is any permutation of $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ that leaves <em>n</em> fixed, π can be written as a product of those transpositions. If π moves <em>n</em> to <em>j</em> then $\pi(j\;\;n{-}1)(n{-}1\;\;n)=\rho$ fixes <em>n</em>; hence $\pi=\rho(n{-}1\;\;n)(j\;\;n{-}1)$ can be written as a product of the given transpositions.</p>

Consider the directed graph <em>G</em> with vertices $V_1,\ldots,V_{13}$ and with an arc from $V_j$ to $V_k$ for each <em>k</em> in pile <em>j</em>; this graph is balanced.

This answer can be obtained, as the author first obtained it, by laborious enumeration of oriented trees of special types and the application of generating functions, etc., based on the methods of <a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02lev3sec4">Section 2.3.4.4</a>. But such a simple answer deserves <a id="page_582"></a>a simple, direct proof, and indeed there is one [see Tor B. Staver, <em>Norsk Matematisk Tidsskrift</em> <strong>28</strong> (1946), 88–89]. Define an order for turning up <em>all</em> cards of the deck, as follows: Obey the rules of the game until getting stuck, then “cheat” by turning up the first available card (find the first pile that is not empty, going clockwise from pile 1) and continue as before, until eventually all cards have been turned up. The cards <em>in the order of turning up</em> are in completely random order (since the value of a card need not be specified until after it is turned up). So the problem is just to calculate the probability that in a randomly shuffled deck the last card is a king. More generally the probability that <em>k</em> cards are still face down when the game is over is the probability that the last king in a random shuffle is followed by <em>k</em> cards, namely $4!\binom{51-k}{3}\frac{48!}{52!}$. Hence a person playing this game without cheating will turn up an average of exactly 42.4 cards per game. <em>Note:</em> Similarly, it can be shown that the probability that the player will have to “cheat” <em>k</em> times in the process described above is exactly given by the Stirling number ${13\brack k+1}/13!$. (See Eq. <a href="../Text/ch01a.html#ch01lev2sec10">1.2.10</a>–(<a href="../Text/ch01a.html#ch01eq-lev2sec10-9">9</a>) and <a href="../Text/ch01a.html#ch01ex_2_10_7">exercise 1.2.10–7</a>; the case of a more general card deck is considered in <a href="../Text/ch01a.html#ch01ex_2_10_18">exercise 1.2.10–18</a>.)</p>

(a) If there is a cycle $(V_0,V_1,\ldots,V_k)$, where necessarily $3≤k≤n$, the sum of the <em>k</em> rows of <em>A</em> corresponding to the <em>k</em> edges of this cycle, with appropriate signs, is a row of zeros; so if <em>G</em> is not a free tree the determinant of $A_0$ is zero.</p>

  <p class="indent">But if <em>G</em> is a free tree we may regard it as an ordered tree with root $V_0$, and we can rearrange the rows and columns of $A_0$ so that columns are in preorder and so that the <em>k</em>th row corresponds to the edge from the <em>k</em>th vertex (column) to its parent. Then the matrix is triangular with $±1\rm\unicode{39}s$ on the diagonal, so the determinant is $±1$.</p>

  <p>where $A_{\large i_1\ldots i_n}$ represents a matrix consisting of rows $i_1,\ldots,i_n$ of $A_0$ (thus corresponding to a choice of <em>n</em> edges of <em>G</em>). The result now follows from (a).</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_3_2_19" id="ch02ex_3_2_19a">19</a>. (a) The conditions $a_{00}=0$ and $a_{jj}=1$ are just conditions (a), (b) of the definition of oriented tree. If <em>G</em> is not an oriented tree there is an oriented cycle (by <a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_3_2_7">exercise 7</a>), and the rows of $A_0$ corresponding to the vertices in this oriented cycle will sum to a row of zeros; hence $\det A_0=0$. If <em>G</em> is an oriented tree, assign an arbitrary order to the children of each family and regard <em>G</em> as an ordered tree. Now permute rows and columns of $A_0$ until they correspond to preorder of the vertices. Since the same permutation has been applied to the rows as to the columns, the determinant is unchanged; and the resulting matrix is triangular with $+1$ in every diagonal position.</p>

  <p class="indent">(b) We may assume that $a_{0j}=0$ for all <em>j</em>, since no arc emanating from $V_0$ can participate in an oriented subtree. We may also assume that $a_{jj}\gt0$ for all $j\ge1$ since otherwise the whole <em>j</em>th row is zero and there obviously are no oriented subtrees. Now use induction on the number of arcs: If $a_{jj}\gt1$ let <em>e</em> be some arc leading from $V_j$; let $B_0$ be a matrix like $A_0$ but with arc <em>e</em> deleted, and let $C_0$ be the matrix like $A_0$ but with all arcs <em>except</em> <em>e</em> that lead from $V_j$ deleted. <em>Example:</em> If <span class="middle"><img src="../Images/e582_04.png" /></span>, $j=1$, and <em>e</em> is an arc from $V_1$ to $V_0$, then <span class="middle"><img src="../Images/e582_05.png" /></span>, <span class="middle"><img src="../Images/e582_06.png" /></span>. In general we have $\det A_0=\det B_0+det C_0$, since the matrices agree in all rows except row <em>j</em>, and $A_0$ is the sum of $B_0$ and $C_0$ in that row. Moreover, the number of oriented subtrees of <em>G</em> is the number of subtrees that do <em>not</em> use <em>e</em> (namely, $\det B_0$, by induction) plus the number that <em>do</em> use <em>e</em> (namely, $\det C_0$).</p>

  <p class="indent" id="page_583"><em>Notes:</em> The matrix <em>A</em> is often called the <em>Laplacian</em> of the graph, by analogy with a similar concept in the theory of partial differential equations. If we delete any set <em>S</em> of rows from the matrix <em>A</em>, and the same set of columns, the determinant of the resulting matrix is the number of oriented forests whose roots are the vertices $\{V_k\mid k\in S\}$ and whose arcs belong to the given digraph. The matrix tree theorem for oriented trees was stated without proof by J. J. Sylvester in 1857 (see <a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_3_2_28">exercise 28</a>), then forgotten for many years until it was independently rediscovered by W. T. Tutte [<em>Proc. Cambridge Phil.

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_3_2_27" id="ch02ex_3_2_27a">27</a>. Let $a_{ij}$ be the sum of $p(e)$ over all arcs <em>e</em> from $V_i$ to $V_j$. We are to prove that $t_j=∑_ia_{ij}t_i$ for all <em>j</em>. Since $∑_ia_{ji}=1$, we must prove that $∑_ia_{ji}t_j=∑_ia_{ij}t_i$. But this is not difficult, because both sides of the equation represent the sum of all products $p(e_1)\ldots p(e_n)$ taken over subgraphs $\{e_1,\ldots,e_n\}$ of <em>G</em> such that ${\rm init}(e_i)=V_i$ and such that there is a unique oriented cycle contained in $\{e_1,\ldots,e_n\}$, where this cycle includes $V_j$. Removing any arc of the cycle yields an oriented tree; the left-hand side of the equation is obtained by factoring out the arcs that leave $V_j$, while the right-hand side corresponds to those that enter $V_j$.</p>

  <p class="indent">In a sense, this exercise is a combination of <a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_3_2_19">exercises 19</a> and <a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_3_2_26">26</a>.</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_3_2_28" id="ch02ex_3_2_28a">28</a>. Every term in the expansion is $\large a_{1p_1}\ldots a_{mp_m}b_{1q_1}\ldots b_{nq_n}$, where $0≤p_i≤n$ for $1≤i≤m$ and $0≤q_j≤m$ for $1≤j≤n$, times some integer coefficient. Represent this product as a directed graph on the vertices $\{0,u_1,\ldots,u_m,v_1,\ldots,v_n\}$, with arcs from $u_i$ to $v_{pi}$ and from $v_j$ to $u_{qj}$, where $u_0=v_0=0$.</p>

  <p class="indent">If the digraph contains a cycle, the integer coefficient is zero. For each cycle corresponds to a factor of the form</p>

  <p class="image"><img src="../Images/e585_01.png" /></p>

  <p>where the indices $(i_0,i_1,\ldots,i_{k-1})$ are distinct and so are the indices $(j_0,j_1,\ldots,j_{k-1})$. The sum of all terms containing $(*)$ as a factor is $(*)$ times the determinant obtained by setting $\large a_{i_lj}←[j=j_l]$ for $0≤j≤n$ and $\large b_{j_li}←[i=i_{(l+1)\bmod k}]$ for $0≤i≤m$, for $0≤l\lt k$, leaving the variables in the other $m+n-2k$ rows unchanged. This determinant is identically zero, because the sum of rows $i_0,i_1,\ldots,i_{k-1}$ in the top section equals the sum of rows $j_0,j_1,\ldots,j_{k-1}$ in the bottom section.</p>

  <p class="indent">On the other hand, if the directed graph contains no cycles, the integer coefficient is $+1$. This follows because each factor $\large a_{ip_i}$ and $\large b_{jq_j}$ must have come from the diagonal of the determinant: If any off-diagonal element $\large a_{i_0j_0}$ is chosen in row $i_0$ of the top section, we must choose some off-diagonal $\large b_{j_0i_1}$ from row $j_0$ of the bottom section, hence we must choose some off-diagonal $\large a_{i_1j_1}$ from row $i_1$ of the top section, etc., forcing a cycle.</p>

  <p class="indent">Thus the coefficient is $+1$ if and only if the corresponding digraph is an oriented tree with root 0. The number of such terms (hence the number of such oriented trees) is obtained by setting each $a_{ij}$ and $b_{ji}$ to 1; for example,</p>

  <div class="image"><img src="../Images/e585_02.png" /></div>

  <p>In general we obtain $\det\left(\small{\matrix{n+1&amp;n\cr m&amp;m+1}}\right)\cdot\large(n+1)^{m-1}\cdot(m+1)^{n-1}$.</p>

  <p class="indent" id="page_586"><em>Notes:</em> J. J. Sylvester considered the special case $m=n$ and $a_{10}=a_{20}=\cdots=a_{m0}=0$ in <em>Quarterly J. of Pure and Applied Math.</em> <strong>1</strong> (1857), 42–56, where he conjectured (correctly) that the total number of terms is then $n^n(n+1)^{n-1}$. He also stated without proof that the $(n+1)^{n-1}$ nonzero terms present when $a_{ij}=\delta_{ij}$ correspond to all connected cycle-free graphs on $\{0,1,\ldots,n\}$. In that special case, he reduced the determinant to the form in the matrix tree theorem of <a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_3_2_19">exercise 19</a>, e.g.,</p>

  <div class="image"><img src="../Images/e586_01.png" /></div>

  <p>Cayley quoted this result in <em>Crelle</em> <strong>52</strong> (1856), 279, ascribing it to Sylvester; thus it is ironic that the theorem about the number of such graphs is often attributed to Cayley.</p>

  <p class="indent">By negating the first <em>m</em> rows of the given determinant, then negating the first <em>m</em> columns, we can reduce this exercise to the matrix tree theorem.</p>

  <p class="indent">[Matrices having the general form considered in this exercise are important in iterative methods for the solution of partial differential equations, and they are said to have “Property <em>A</em>.” See, for example, Louis A.

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_3_3_3" id="ch02ex_3_3_3a">3</a>. Consider the set of tetrad types <span class="baseline"><img src="../Images/e586_02.png" /></span> for all positive integers <em>j</em>. The right half plane can be tiled in uncountably many ways; but whatever square is placed in the center of the plane puts a finite limit on the distance it can be continued to the left.</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_3_3_4" id="ch02ex_3_3_4a">4</a>. Systematically enumerate all possible ways to tile an $n\times n$ block, for $n=1,2,\ldots$, looking for toroidal solutions within these blocks. If there is no way to tile the plane, the infinity lemma tells us there is an <em>n</em> with no $n\times n$ solutions. If there <em>is</em> a way to tile the plane, the assumption tells us that there is an <em>n</em> with an $n\times n$ solution containing a rectangle that yields a toroidal solution. Hence in either case the algorithm will terminate.</p>

  <p class="indent">[But the stated assumption is false, as shown in the next exercise; and in fact there is no algorithm that will determine in a finite number of steps whether or not there exists a way to tile the plane with a given set of types. On the other hand, if such a tiling does exist, there is always a tiling that is <em>quasitoroidal</em>, in the sense that each of its $n\times n$ blocks occurs at least once in every $f(n)\times f(n)$ block, for some function <em>f</em>. See B. Durand, <em>Theoretical Computer Science</em> <strong>221</strong> (1999), 61–75.]</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_3_3_5" id="ch02ex_3_3_5a">5</a>. Start by noticing that we need classes $\matrix{\alpha&amp;\beta\cr\gamma&amp;\delta}$ replicated in $2\times2$ groups in any solution. Then, step 1: Considering just the <em>α</em> squares, show that the pattern $\matrix{a&amp;b\cr c&amp;d}$ must be replicated in $2\times2$ groups of <em>α</em> squares. Step $n\gt1$: Determine a pattern that must appear in a cross-shaped region of height and width $2^n-1$. The middle of the crosses has the pattern $\matrix{Na&amp;Nb\cr Nc&amp;Nd}$ replicated throughout the plane.</p>

  <p class="indent">For example, after step 3 we will know the contents of $7\times7$ blocks throughout the plane, separated by unit length strips, every eight units. The $7\times7$ blocks that are of <a id="page_587"></a>class $Na$ in the center have the form</p>

  <div class="image"><img src="../Images/e587_01.png" /></div>

  <p>The middle column and the middle row is the “cross” just filled in during step 3; the other four $3\times3$ squares were filled in after step 2; the squares just to the right and below this $7\times7$ square are part of a $15\times15$ cross to be filled in at step 4.</p>

  <p class="indent">For a similar construction that leads to a set of only 35 tetrad types having nothing but nontoroidal solutions, see R. M. Robinson, <em>Inventiones Math.</em> <strong>12</strong> (1971), 177–209. Robinson also exhibits a set of <em>six</em> squarish shapes that tile the plane only nontoroidally, even when rotations and reflections are allowed. In 1974, Roger Penrose discovered a set of only <em>two</em> polygons, based on the golden ratio instead of a square grid, that tile the plane only aperiodically; this led to a set of only 16 tetrad types with only nontoroidal solutions [see B. Grünbaum and G. C. Shephard, <em>Tilings and Patterns</em> (Freeman, 1987), Chapters 10–11; Martin Gardner, <em>Penrose Tiles to Trapdoor Ciphers</em> (Freeman, 1989), <a href="../Text/ch01.html#ch01">Chapters 1</a>–<a href="../Text/ch02.html#ch02">2</a>].</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_3_3_6" id="ch02ex_3_3_6a">6</a>. Let <em>k</em> and <em>m</em> be fixed. Consider an oriented tree whose vertices each represent, for some <em>n</em>, one of the partitions of $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ into <em>k</em> parts, containing no arithmetic progression of length <em>m</em>. A node that partitions $\{1,\ldots,n+1\}$ is a child of one for $\{1,\ldots,n\}$ if the two partitions agree on $\{1,\ldots,n\}$. If there were an infinite path to the root we would have a way to divide <em>all</em> integers into <em>k</em> sets with no arithmetic progression of length <em>m</em>. Hence, by the infinity lemma and van der Waerden’s theorem, this tree is finite. (If $k=2$, $m=3$, the tree can be rapidly calculated by hand, and the least value of <em>N</em> is 9. See <em>Studies in Pure Mathematics</em>, ed. by L. Mirsky (Academic Press, 1971), 251–260, for van der Waerden’s interesting account of how the proof of his theorem was discovered.)</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_3_3_7" id="ch02ex_3_3_7a">7</a>. The positive integers can be partitioned into two sets $S_0$ and $S_1$ such that neither set contains any infinite <em>computable</em> sequence (see exercise 3.5–32). So in particular there is no infinite arithmetic progression. <a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02theor-k">Theorem K</a> does not apply because there is no way to put partial solutions into a tree with finite degrees at each vertex.</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_3_3_8" id="ch02ex_3_3_8a">8</a>. Let a “counterexample sequence” be an infinite sequence of trees that violates Kruskal’s theorem, if such sequences exist. Assume that the theorem is false; then let $T_1$ be a tree with the smallest possible number of nodes such that $T_1$ can be the first tree in a counterexample sequence; if $T_1,\ldots,T_j$ have been chosen, let $T_{j+1}$ be a tree with the smallest possible number of nodes such that $T_1,\ldots,T_j,T_{j+1}$ is the beginning of a counterexample sequence. This process defines a counterexample sequence $\langle T_n\rangle$. None of these $T\rm\unicode{39}s$ is just a root. Now, we look at this sequence very carefully:</p>

  <p class="indent">(a) Suppose there is a subsequence $T_{n_1},T_{n_2},\ldots$ for which $l(T_{n_1}),l(T_{n_2}),\ldots$ is a counterexample sequence. This is impossible; otherwise $T_1,\ldots,T_{n_1-1},l(T_{n_1}),l(T_{n_2}),\ldots$ would be a counterexample sequence, contradicting the definition of $T_{n_1}$.</p>

  <p class="indent" id="page_588">(b) Because of (a), there are only finitely many <em>j</em> for which $l(T_j)$ cannot be embedded in $l(T_k)$ for any $k\gt j$. Therefore by taking $n_1$ larger than any such <em>j</em> we can find a subsequence for which $l(T_{n_1})\subseteq l(T_{n_2})\subseteq l(T_{n_3})\subseteq\cdots$.</p>

  <p class="indent">(c) Now by the result of <a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02ex_2_8_22">exercise 2.3.2–22</a>, $r(T_{n_j})$ cannot be embedded in $r(T_{n_k})$ for any $k\gt j$, else $T_{n_j}\subseteq T_{n_k}$. Therefore $T_1,\ldots,T_{n_1-1},r(T_{n_1}),r(T_{n_2}),\ldots$ is a counterexample sequence. But this contradicts the definition of $T_{n_1}$.</p>

  <p class="indent"><em>Notes:</em> Kruskal, in <em>Trans. Amer. Math. Soc.</em> <strong>95</strong> (1960), 210–225, actually proved a stronger result, using a weaker notion of embedding. His theorem does not follow directly from the infinity lemma, although the results are vaguely similar. Indeed, K<span class="baseline"><img src="../Images/oprime.png" /></span>nig himself proved a special case of Kruskal’s theorem, showing that there is no infinite sequence of pairwise incomparable <em>n</em>-tuples of nonnegative integers, where comparability means that all components of one <em>n</em>-tuple are $≤$ the corresponding components of the other [<em>Matematikai és Fizikai Lapok</em> <strong>39</strong> (1932), 27–29].

  <p>Now interchange the order of summation.</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_3_4_4" id="ch02ex_3_4_4a">4</a>. (a) $A(z)$ certainly converges at least for $|z|\lt\frac14$, since $a_n$ is less than the number of <em>ordered</em> trees $b_{n-1}$. Since $A(1)$ is infinite and all coefficients are positive, there is a positive number $\alpha≤1$ such that $A(z)$ converges for $|z|\lt\alpha$, and there is a singularity at $z=\alpha$. Let $\psi(z)=A(z)/z$; since $\psi(z)\gt e^{z\psi(z)}$, we see that $\psi(z)=m$ implies $z\lt\ln m/m$, so $\psi(z)$ is bounded and $\lim_{z→\alpha-}\psi(z)$ exists. Thus $\alpha\lt1$, and by Abel’s limit theorem $a=\alpha\cdot\exp\left(a+\frac12 A(\alpha^2)+\frac13 A(\alpha^3)+\cdots\right)$.</p>

  <p class="indent">(b) $A(z^2),A(z^3),\ldots$ are analytic for $|z|\lt\sqrt\alpha$, and $\frac12 A(z^2)+\frac13 A(z^3)+\cdots$ converges uniformly in a slightly smaller disk.</p>

  <p class="indent">(c) If $\partial F/\partial w=a-1\neq0$, the implicit function theorem implies that there is an analytic function $f(z)$ in a neighborhood of $(\alpha,a/\alpha)$ such that $F(z,f(z))=0$. But this implies $f(z)=A(z)/z$, contradicting the fact that $A(z)$ is singular at <em>α</em>.</p>

  <p class="indent">(d) Obvious.</p>

  <p class="indent">(e) $\partial F/\partial w=A(z)-1$ and $|A(z)|\lt A(\alpha)=1$, since the coefficients of $A(z)$ are all positive. Hence, as in (c), $A(z)$ is regular at all such points.</p>

  <p class="indent">(f) Near $(\alpha,1/\alpha)$ we have the identity $0=\beta(z-\alpha)+(\alpha/2)(w-1/\alpha)^2+$ higher order terms, where $w=A(z)/z$; so <em>w</em> is an analytic function of $\sqrt{z-\alpha}$ here by the implicit function theorem. Consequently there is a region $|z|\lt\alpha_1$ minus a cut $[\alpha,\alpha_1]$ in which $A(z)$ has the stated form. (The minus sign is chosen since a plus sign would make the coefficients ultimately negative.)</p>

  <p class="indent">(g) Any function of the stated form has coefficient asymptotically ${\frac{\sqrt{2\beta}}{\alpha^n}}\binom{1/2}{n}$.</p>

Define the canonical representation $f(V_1),f(V_2),\ldots,f(V_{m-k})$ as in the text; now $f(V_{m-k})$ is in the cycle, so we continue to get a “canonical representation” by writing down the rest of the cycle $f(f(V_{m-k}))$, $f(f(f(V_{m-k})))$, etc. For example, the function with $m=13$ whose graph is shown here leads to the representation 3, 1, 8, 8, 1, 12, 12, 2, 3, 4, 5, 1. We obtain a sequence of $m-1$ numbers in which the last <em>k</em> are distinct.

  <p class="center">$(n_0+n_1+\cdots+n_m-1)!/n_0!n_1!\ldots n_m!$.</p>

  <p class="indent">To prove this result we recall that an unlabeled tree with $n=n_0+n_1+\cdots+n_m$ nodes is characterized by the sequence $d_1d_2\ldots d_n$ of the degrees of the nodes in postorder (<a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02lev2sec9">Section 2.3.3</a>). Furthermore such a sequence of degrees corresponds to a tree if and only if $∑_{j=1}^k(1-d_j)\gt0$ for $0\lt k≤n$. (This important property of Polish postfix notation is readily proved by induction; see <a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02alg-lev2sec9-F">Algorithm 2.3.3F</a> with <em>f</em> a function that creates a tree, like the <code>TREE</code> function of <a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02lev2sec8">Section 2.3.2</a>.) In particular, $d_1$ must be 0. The answer to our problem is therefore the number of sequences $d_2\ldots d_n$ with $n_j$ occurrences of <em>j</em> for $j\gt0$, namely the multinomial coefficient</p>

  <div class="image"><img src="../Images/e593_02.png" /></div>

  <p>minus the number of such sequences $d_2\ldots d_n$ for which $∑_{j=2}^k(1-d_j)\lt0$ for some $k\ge2$.</p>

  <p class="indent">We may enumerate the latter sequences as follows: Let <em>t</em> be minimal such that $∑_{j=2}^t(1-d_j)\lt0$; then $∑_{j=2}^t(1-d_j)=-s$ where $1≤s\lt d_t$, and we may form the subsequence $d'_2\ldots d'_n=d_{t-1}\ldots d_20d_{t+1}\ldots d_n$, which has $n_j$ occurrences of <em>j</em> for $j\neq d_t$, $n_j-1$ occurrences of <em>j</em> for $j=d_t$. Now $∑_{j=2}^k(1-d'_j)$ is equal to $d_t$ when $k=n$, and equal to $d_t-s$ when $k=t$; when $k\lt t$, it is</p>

  <div class="image"><img src="../Images/e593_08.png" /></div>

  <p>It follows that, given <em>s</em> and any sequence $d'_2\ldots d'_n$, the construction can be reversed; hence the number of sequences $d_2\ldots d_n$ that have a given value of $d_t$ and <em>s</em> is the multinomial coefficient</p>

  <div class="image"><img src="../Images/e593_10.png" /></div>

  <p>The number of sequences $d_2\ldots d_n$ that correspond to trees is therefore obtained by summing over the possible values of $d_t$ and <em>s</em>:</p>

  <div class="image"><img src="../Images/e593_11.png" /></div>

  <p>and the latter sum is 1.</p>

  <p class="indent">An even simpler proof of this result has been given by G. N. Raney (<em>Transactions of the American Math. Society</em> <strong>94</strong> (1960), 441–451). If $d_1d_2\ldots d_n$ is any sequence with $n_j$ appearances of <em>j</em>, there is precisely one cyclic rearrangement $d_k\ldots d_nd_1\ldots d_{k-1}$ that corresponds to a tree, namely the rearrangement where <em>k</em> is maximal such that $∑_{j=1}^{k-1}(1-d_j)$ is minimal. [This argument in the case of binary trees was apparently first discovered by C. S. Peirce in an unpublished manuscript; see his <em>New Elements of Mathematics</em> <strong>4</strong> (The Hague: Mouton, 1976), 303–304. It was discovered in the case of <em>t</em>-ary trees by Dvoretzky and Motzkin, <em>Duke Math. J.</em> <strong>14</strong> (1947), 305–313.]</p>

  <p class="indent">Still another proof, by G. Bergman, inductively replaces $d_kd_{k+1}$ by $(d_k+d_{k+1}-1)$ if $d_k\gt0$ [<em>Algebra Universalis</em> <strong>8</strong> (1978), 129–130].</p>

  <p class="indent" id="page_594">The methods above can be generalized to show that the number of (ordered, unlabeled) forests having <em>f</em> trees and $n_j$ nodes of degree <em>j</em> is $(n-1)!f/n_0!n_1!\ldots n_m!$, provided that the condition $n_0=f+n_2+2n_3+\cdots$ is satisfied.</p>

The generating function $\large G(z_1,z_2,\ldots)=∑c(n_1,n_2,\ldots)z_1^{n_1}z_2^{n_2}\ldots$ satisfies the identity $\large G=z_1G^{e_1}+\cdots+z_rG^{e_r}$, since $\large z_jG^{e_j}$ enumerates the trees whose root is labeled <em>j</em>.

Given a triangulation, let the triangle on the base correspond to the root of a binary tree, and let the other two sides of that triangle define bases of left and right subpolygons, which correspond to left and right subtrees in the same way.

  <p class="indent">Stating this correspondence another way, we can label the non-base edges of a triangulated polygon with the integers $0,\ldots,n$; and when two adjacent sides of a triangle are labeled <em>α</em> and <em>β</em> in clockwise order, we can label the third side $(\alpha\beta)$.

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_3_6_3" id="ch02ex_3_6_3a">3</a>. (a) Let the vertices be $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$. Draw an <code>RLINK</code> from <em>i</em> to <em>j</em> if <em>i</em> and <em>j</em> are consecutive elements of the same part and $i\lt j$; draw an <code>LLINK</code> from <em>j</em> to $j+1$ if $j+1$ is the smallest of its part. Then there are $k-1$ nonnull <code>LLINK</code>s, $n-k$ nonnull <code>RLINK</code>s, and we have a binary tree whose nodes are $12\ldots n$ in preorder. Using the natural correspondence of <a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02lev2sec8">Section 2.3.2</a>, this rule defines a one-to-one correspondence between “partitions of an <em>n</em>-gon's vertices into <em>k</em> noncrossing parts” and “forests with <em>n</em> vertices and $n-k+1$ leaves.” Interchanging <code>LLINK</code> with <code>RLINK</code> also gives “forests with <em>n</em> vertices and <em>k</em> leaves.”</p>

  <p class="indent">(b) A forest with <em>n</em> vertices and <em>k</em> leaves also corresponds to a sequence of nested parentheses, containing <em>n</em> left parentheses, <em>n</em> right parentheses, and <em>k</em> occurrences of “()”. We can enumerate such sequences as follows:</p>

  <p class="indent" id="page_598">Say that a string of 0s and 1s is an $(m,n,k)$ string if there are <em>m</em> 0s, <em>n</em> 1s, and <em>k</em> occurrences of “01”. Then 0010101001110 is a $(7,6,4)$ string. The number of $(m,n,k)$ strings is ${\binom{m}{k}}{\binom{n}{k}}$, because we are free to choose which 0s and 1s will form the 01 pairs.</p>

  <p class="indent">Let $S(\alpha)$ be the number of 0s in <em>α</em> minus the number of 1s. We say that a string σ is <em>good</em> if $S(\alpha)\ge0$ whenever <em>α</em> is a prefix of σ (in other words, if $\sigma=\alpha\beta$ implies that $S(\alpha)\ge0$); otherwise σ is <em>bad</em>. The following alternative to the “reflection principle” of <a href="../Text/ch02.html#ch02ex_2_1_4">exercise 2.2.1–4</a> establishes a one-to-one correspondence between bad $(n,n,k)$ strings and arbitrary $(n-1,n+1,k)$ strings:</p>

  <p class="indent">Any bad $(n,n,k)$ string σ can be written uniquely in the form $\sigma=\alpha0\beta$, where $\overline\alpha^R$ and <em>β</em> are good. (Here $\overline\alpha^R$ is the string obtained from <em>α</em> by reversing it and complementing all the bits.) Then $\sigma'=\alpha1\beta$ is an $(n-1,n+1,k)$ string. Conversely, every $(n-1,n+1,k)$ string can be written uniquely in the form $\alpha1\beta$ where $\overline\alpha^R$ and <em>β</em> are good, and $\alpha0\beta$ is then a bad $(n,n,k)$ string.</p>

  <p class="indent">Thus the number of forests with <em>n</em> vertices and <em>k</em> leaves is $\binom{n}{k}\binom{n}{k}-\binom{n-1}{k}\binom{n+1}{k}=$ ${\binom{n-1}{k-1}}{\binom{n}{k}}-{\binom{n-1}{k}}{\binom{n}{k-1}}=$ $n!\,(n-1)!/(n-k+1)!\,(n-k)!\,k!\,(k-1)!$, a so-called <em>Narayana number</em> [T. V. Narayana, <em>Comptes Rendus Acad. Sci.</em> <strong>240</strong> (Paris, 1955), 1188–1189].</p>

  <p class="indent"><em>Notes:</em> G. Kreweras, <em>Discrete Math.</em> <strong>1</strong> (1972), 333–350, enumerated noncrossing partitions in a different way. The partial ordering of partitions by refinement leads to an interesting partial ordering of forests, different from the one discussed in <a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_3_6_2">exercise 2</a>.3.3– 19; see Y.

  <p class="indent">A third way to define a natural lattice ordering of forests was introduced by R. Stanley in <em>Fibonacci Quarterly</em> <strong>13</strong> (1975), 215–232: Suppose we represent a forest by a string σ of 0s and 1s representing left and right parentheses as above; then $\sigma≤\sigma'$ if and only if $S(\sigma_k)≤S(\sigma'_k)$ for all <em>k</em>, where $\sigma_k$ denotes the first <em>k</em> bits of σ.

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_3_6_4" id="ch02ex_3_6_4a">4</a>. Let $m=n+2$; by <a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_3_6_1">exercise 1</a>, we want a correspondence between triangulated <em>m</em>-gons and $(m-1)\unicode{45}\rm rowed$ friezes. First let’s look more closely at the previous correspondence, by giving a “top-down” labeling to the edges of a triangulation instead of the “bottom-up” one considered earlier: Assign the empty label $\epsilon$ to the base, then recursively give the labels $\alpha L$ and $\alpha R$ to the opposite edges of a triangle whose base is labeled <em>α</em>. For example, the previous diagram becomes</p>

  <div class="image"><img src="../Images/598fig01.png" /></div>

  <p>under these new conventions. If the base edge in this example is called 10, while the other edges are 0 to 9 as before, we can write $0=10LLL$, $1=10LLR$, $2=10LR$, <a id="page_599"></a>$3=10RLL$, etc. Any of the other edges can also be chosen as the base; thus, if 0 is chosen we have $1=0L$, $2=0RL$, $3=0RRLLL$, etc. It is not difficult to verify that if $u=v\alpha$ we have $v=u\alpha^T$, where $\alpha^T$ is obtained by reading <em>α</em> from right to left and interchanging <em>L</em> with <em>R</em>. For example, $10=0RRR=1LRR=2LR=3RRL$, etc. If <em>u</em>, <em>υ</em>, and <em>w</em> are edges of the polygon with $w=u\alpha L\gamma$ and $w=v\beta R\gamma$, then $u=v\beta L\alpha^T$ and $v=u\alpha R\beta^T$.</p>

  <p class="indent">Given a triangulation of a polygon whose edges are numbered $0,1,\ldots,m-1$, we define $(u,v)$ for any pair of distinct edges <em>u</em> and <em>υ</em> as follows: Let $u=v\alpha$, and interpret <em>α</em> as a $2\times2$ matrix by letting $L=\left(\matrix{1&amp;1\\0&amp;1}\right)$ and $R=\left(\matrix{1&amp;0\\1&amp;1}\right)$. Then $(u,v)$ is defined to be the element in the upper left corner of <em>α</em>. Notice that $\alpha^T$ is the transpose of the matrix <em>α</em>, since $R=L^T$; hence we have $(v,u)=(u,v)$. Notice also that $(u,v)=1$ if and only if $u_-$ and $v_-$ are joined by an edge of the triangulation, where $u_-$ denotes the vertex between edges <em>u</em> and $u-1$.</p>

  <p class="indent">Let $(u,u)=0$ for all polygon edges <em>u</em>. We can now prove that $v=u\alpha$ implies</p>

  <div class="image"><img src="../Images/e599_03.png" /></div>

  <p>where $u+1$ and $v+1$ are the clockwise successors of <em>u</em> and <em>υ</em>. The proof is by induction on <em>m</em>: Eq. $(*)$ is trivial when $m=2$, since the two parallel edges <em>u</em> and <em>υ</em> are then related by $u=v\epsilon$, and $\alpha=\epsilon$ is the identity matrix. If any triangulation is augmented by extending some edge <em>υ</em> with a triangle $v\;v'\;v''$, then $v=u\alpha$ implies $v'=u\alpha L$ and $v''=u\alpha R$; hence $(u,v')$ and $(u,v'')$ in the extended polygon are respectively equal to $(u,v)$ and $(u,v)+(u,v+1)$ in the original one. It follows that</p>

  <div class="image"><img src="../Images/e599_04.png" /></div>

  <p>and $(*)$ remains true in the extended polygon.</p>

  <p class="indent">The frieze pattern corresponding to the given triangulation is now defined to be the periodic sequence</p>

  <div class="image"><img src="../Images/e599_05.png" /></div>

  <p>and so on until $m-1$ rows have been defined; the final row begins with $(\lceil{m/2}\rceil+1,\lceil{m/2}\rceil)$ when $m\gt3$. Condition $(*)$ proves that this pattern is a frieze, namely that</p>

  <p><a id="page_600"></a>The relation $(u,v)=1$ defines the edges of the triangulation, hence different triangulations yield different friezes. To complete the proof of one-to-one correspondence, we must show that every $(m-1)\unicode{45}\rm rowed$ frieze pattern of positive integers is obtained in this way from some triangulation.</p>

  <p class="indent">Given any frieze of $m-1$ rows, extend it by putting a new row 0 at the top and a new row <em>m</em> at the bottom, both consisting entirely of zeros. Now let the elements of row 0 be called $(0,0)$, $(1,1)$, $(2,2)$, etc., and for all nonnegative integers $u\lt v≤u+m$ let $(u,v)$ be the element in the diagonal southeast of $(u,u)$ and in the diagonal southwest of $(v,v)$. By assumption, condition $(**)$ holds for all $u\lt v\lt u+m$. We can in fact extend $(**)$ to the considerably more general relation</p>

  <div class="image"><img src="../Images/e600_01.png" /></div>

  <p>For if $(***)$ is false, let $(t,u,v,w)$ be a counterexample with the smallest value of $(w-t)m+u-t+w-v$. Clearly $t\neq u$ and $v\neq w$. <em>Case 1:</em> $t+1\lt u$. Then $(***)$ holds for $(t,t+1,v,w)$, $(t,t+1,u,v)$, and $(t+1,u,v,w)$, so we find $((t,u)(v,w)+(t,w)(u,v))(t+1,v)=(t,v)(u,w)(t+1,v)$; this implies $(t+1,v)=0$, a contradiction. <em>Case 2:</em> $v+1\lt w$. Then $(***)$ holds for $(t,u,w-1,w)$, $(u,v,w-1,w)$, and $(t,u,v,w-1)$; we obtain a similar contradiction $(u,w-1)=0$. <em>Case 3:</em> $u=t+1$ and $w=v+1$. In this case $(***)$ reduces to $(**)$.</p>

  <p class="indent">Now we set $u=t+1$ and $w=t+m$ in $(***)$, obtaining $(t,v)=(v,t+m)$ for $t≤v≤t+m$, because $(t+1,t+m)=1$ and $(t,t+m)=0$. We conclude that the entries of any $(m-1)\unicode{45}\rm rowed$ frieze are periodic: $(u,v)=(v,u+m)=(u+m,v+m)=(v+m,u+2m)=\cdots$.</p>

  <p class="indent">Every frieze pattern of positive integers contains a 1 in row 2. For if we set $t=0$, $v=u+1$, and $w=u+2$ in $(***)$ we get $(0,u+1)(u,u+2)=(0,u)+(0,u+2)$, hence $(0,u+2)-(0,u+1)\ge (0,u+1)-(0,u)$ if and only if $(u,u+2)\ge2$. This cannot hold for all <em>u</em> in the range $0≤u≤m-2$, because $(0,1)-(0,0)=1$ and $(0,m)-(0,m-1)=-1$.</p>

  <p class="indent">Finally, if $m\gt3$ we cannot have two consecutive 1s in row 2, because $(u,u+2)=(u+1,u+3)=1$ implies $(u,u+3)=0$. Therefore we can reduce the frieze to another one with <em>m</em> reduced by 1, as illustrated here for 7 rows reduced to 6:</p>

  <p class="indent"><em>Notes:</em> This proof demonstrates that the function $(u,v)$, which we defined on any triangulation via $2\times2$ matrices, satisfies $(***)$ whenever $(t,u,v,w)$ are edges of the polygon in clockwise order.

In fact, $(j,k)=i^{1-k+j}K_{k-j-1}(ia_{j+1},ia_{j+2},\ldots,ia_{k-1})$. Thus $(***)$ is equivalent to Euler’s identity <a id="page_601"></a>for continuants in the answer to exercise 4.5.3–32. The matrices <em>L</em> and <em>R</em> have the interesting property that any $2\times2$ matrix of nonnegative integers with determinant 1 can be expressed uniquely as a product of $L\unicode{39}\rm s$ and $R\unicode{39}\rm s$.</p>

  <p class="indent">Many other interesting relationships are present; for example, the numbers in row 2 of an integer frieze count the number of triangles touching each vertex of the corresponding triangulated polygon. The total number of occurrences of $(u,v)=1$ in the basic region $0≤u\lt v-1\lt m-1$ and $(u,v)\neq (0,m-1)$ is the number of diagonals (chords) of the triangulation, namely $m-3=n-1$. The total number of 2s is also $n-1$, because $(u,v)=2$ if and only if $u_-$ and $v_-$ are opposing vertices of the two triangles adjacent to a chord.</p>

  <p class="indent">Another interpretation of $(u,v)$ was found by D. Broline, D. W. Crowe, and I. M. Isaacs [<em>Geometriæ Dedicata</em> <strong>3</strong> (1974), 171–176]: It is the number of ways to match the $v-u-1$ vertices between edges <em>u</em> and $v-1$ with distinct triangles adjacent to those vertices.</p>

A List structure is a directed graph in which the arcs leaving each vertex are ordered, and where some of the vertices that have out-degree 0 are designated “atoms.” Furthermore there is a vertex <em>S</em> such that there is an oriented path from <em>S</em> to <em>V</em> for all vertices $V\neq S$.

The representation discussed in <a href="../Text/ch02b.html#ch02ex_3_2_25">exercise 2.3.4.2–25</a>, or some similar method, could perhaps be used (but this idea has not yet been exploited at the time of writing).</p>

If only <code>P0</code> is to be marked, the algorithm certainly operates correctly. If $n\gt1$ nodes are to be marked, we must have ${\tt ATOM(P0)}=0$. Step E4 then sets $\tt ALINK(P0)←\varLambda$ and executes the algorithm with <code>P0</code> replaced by $\tt ALINK(P0)$ and <code>T</code> replaced by <code>P0</code>. By induction (note that since $\tt MARK(P0)$ is now 1, all links to <code>P0</code> are equivalent to <em>Λ</em> by steps E4 and E5), we see that ultimately we will mark all nodes on paths that start with $\tt ALINK(P0)$ and do not pass through <code>P0</code>; and we will then get to step E6 with <code>T</code> = <code>P0</code> and ${\tt P}=\tt ALINK(P0)$. Now since ${\tt ATOM(T)}=1$, step E6 restores $\tt ALINK(P0)$ and $\tt ATOM(P0)$ and we reach step E5. Step E5 sets $\tt BLINK(P0)←\varLambda$, etc., and a similar argument shows that we will ultimately mark all nodes on paths that start with $\tt BLINK(P0)$ and do not pass through <code>P0</code> or nodes reachable from $\tt ALINK(P0)$. Then we will get to E6 with <code>T</code> = <code>P0</code>, ${\tt P}=\tt BLINK(P0)$, and finally we get to E6 with ${\tt T}=\varLambda$, <code>P</code> = <code>P0</code>.</p>

  <p class="indent">Several elegant List-moving and List-copying algorithms that make substantially weaker assumptions about List representation have been devised. See D. W.

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02c.html#ch02ex_2_11_11" id="ch02ex_2_11_11a">11</a>. Here is a pencil-and-paper method that can be written out more formally to answer the problem: First attach a unique name (e.g., a capital letter) to each List in the given set; in the example we might have $A=(a\colon C,b,a\colon F)$, $F=(b\colon D)$, $B=(a\colon F,b,a\colon E)$, $C=(b\colon G)$, $G=(a\colon C)$, $D=(a\colon F)$, $E=(b\colon G)$. Now make a list of pairs of List names that must be proved equal. Successively add pairs to this list until either a contradiction is found because we have a pair that disagree on the first level (then the originally given Lists are unequal), or until the list of pairs does not imply any further pairs (then the originally given Lists are equal). In the example, this list of pairs would originally contain only the given pair, <em>AB</em>; then it gets the further pairs <em>CF</em>, <em>EF</em> (by matching <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>), <em>DG</em> (from <em>CF</em>); and then we have a self-consistent set.</p>

  <p class="indent">To prove the validity of this method, observe that (i) if it returns the answer “unequal”, the given Lists are unequal; (ii) if the given Lists are unequal, it returns the answer “unequal”; (iii) it always terminates.</p>

When the <code>AVAIL</code> list contains <em>N</em> nodes, where <em>N</em> is a specified constant to be chosen as discussed below, initiate another coroutine that shares computer time with the main routine and does the following: (a) Marks all <em>N</em> nodes on the <code>AVAIL</code> list; (b) marks all other nodes that are accessible to the program; (c) links all unmarked nodes together to prepare a new <code>AVAIL</code> list for use when the current <code>AVAIL</code> list is empty, and (d) resets the mark bits in all nodes. One must choose <em>N</em> and the ratio of time sharing so that operations (a), (b), (c), and (d) are guaranteed to be complete before <em>N</em> nodes are taken from the <code>AVAIL</code> list, yet the main routine is running sufficiently fast. It is necessary to use some care in step (b) to make sure that all nodes “accessible to the program” are included, as the program continues to run; details are omitted here. If the list formed in (c) has fewer than <em>N</em> nodes, it may be necessary to stop eventually because memory space might become exhausted. [For further information, see Guy L.

Further details of the proof are filled in as we have done many times before in a “tree induction” (see, for example, the proof of <a href="../Text/ch02a.html#ch02alg-lev2sec7-T">Algorithm 2.3.1T</a>).</p>

Alternatively, if the Data Table entries are ordered so that $\tt PREV(P)\lt P$ for all <code>P</code>, a faster test can be made in an obvious way depending on whether $\tt P\gt Q$ or not, following the <code>PREV</code> links of the larger to see if the smaller is encountered.</p>

A minuscule improvement in the speed of step C4 would be achieved by adding a new link field $\tt SIB1(P)≡CHILD(PARENT(P))$. More significantly, we could modify the <code>CHILD</code> and <code>SIB</code> links so that $\tt NAME(SIB(P))\gt NAME(P)$; this would speed up the search in step C3 considerably because it would require only one pass over each family to find the matching members.

The amount of storage space for an item of length <em>l</em> is $k\lceil{l/(k-b)}\rceil$, which has the average value $kL/(k-b)+(1-\alpha)k$, where <em>α</em> is assumed to be $1/2$, independent of <em>k</em>. This expression is a minimum (for real values of <em>k</em>) when $k=b+\sqrt{2bL}$. So choose <em>k</em> to be the integer just above or just below this value, whichever gives the lowest value of $kL/(k-b)+\frac{1}{2}k$. For example, if $b=1$ and $L=10$, we would choose $k\approx1+\sqrt{20}=5\;\rm or\;6$; both are equally good.

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02c.html#ch02ex_1_5_6" id="ch02ex_1_5_6a">6</a>. The idea is to try to search in different parts of the <code>AVAIL</code> list each time. We can use a “roving pointer,” called <code>ROVER</code> for example, which is treated as follows: In step A1, set $\tt Q←ROVER$. After step A4, set $\tt ROVER←LINK(Q)$ if $\tt LINK(Q)\neq\varLambda$, otherwise set $\tt ROVER←LOC(AVAIL)$. In step A2, when ${\tt P}=\varLambda$ the first time during a particular execution of <a href="../Text/ch02c.html#ch02alg-lev1sec5-A">Algorithm A</a>, set ${\tt Q←LOC(AVAIL)}$ and repeat step A2. When ${\tt P}=\varLambda$ the <em>second</em> time, the algorithm terminates unsuccessfully. In this way <code>ROVER</code> will tend to <a id="page_608"></a>point to a random spot in the <code>AVAIL</code> list, and the sizes will be more balanced. At the beginning of the program, set $\tt ROVER←LOC(AVAIL)$; it is <em>also</em> necessary to set <code>ROVER</code> to $\tt LOC(AVAIL)$ everywhere else in the program where the block whose address equals the current setting of <code>ROVER</code> is taken out of the <code>AVAIL</code> list. (Sometimes, however, it is useful to have small blocks at the beginning, as in the strict first-fit method; for example, we might want to keep a sequential stack at the high end of memory. In such cases we can reduce the search time by using trees as suggested in exercise 6.2.3–30.)</p>

  <p class="uln-indentC"><strong>A5′′.</strong> [Better fit?] If $\tt M\gt SIZE(P)$, set $\tt R←Q$ and $\tt M←SIZE(P)$. Then set $\tt Q←P$ and return to A2′′.</p>

(When there are only very few different block sizes, this occurs rather often.) If a “boundary tag” method like <a href="../Text/ch02c.html#ch02alg-lev1sec5-C">Algorithm C</a> is being used, it is possible to maintain the <code>AVAIL</code> list in sorted order by size; so the length of search could be cut down to half the length of the list or less, on the average. But the best solution is to make the <code>AVAIL</code> list into a balanced tree structure as described in Section 6.2.3, if it is expected to be long.</p>

The ratio $a_n/b_n$ for large <em>n</em> is essentially ${4\left(\alpha-\frac23\right)}/\alpha^2$, which takes its minimum value $\frac43$ when $\alpha=1\;\rm and\;2$, and its maximum value $\frac32$ when $\alpha=1\frac13$. So $a_n/b_n$ approaches no limit; it oscillates between these two extremes.

There are 17 gaps of empty seats between the occupied seats, counting one gap at each end, with a gap of length zero assumed between adjacent occupied seats. The total number of empty seats, namely the sum of all seventeen gaps, is 6. Suppose <em>x</em> of the gaps are of odd length; then $6-x$ spaces are available to seat pairs. (Note that $6-x$ is even and $\ge0$.) Now each of the customers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, from left to right, who has an even gap on both sides, finishes his lunch and walks out. Each odd gap prevents at most one of these eight diners from leaving, hence at least $8-x$ people leave. There <em>still</em> are only $6-x$ spaces available to seat pairs. But now $(8-x)/2$ pairs enter.</p>

To process a request for space, put each block into the first region for which the stated capacity is not exceeded, using the relevant optimum strategy for that region. This cannot fail, for if we were unable to fill a request for <em>x</em> locations we must have at least $(n_1-x+1)+(n_2-x+1)+(2m-x-1)\gt n_1+n_2-x$ locations already occupied.</p>

  <p class="indent">Now if $f(n)=N(n,m)+N(2m-2,m)$, we have the subadditive law $f(n_1+n_2)≤f(n_1)+f(n_2)$. Hence $\lim f(n)/n$ exists. (<em>Proof:</em> $f(a+bc)≤f(a)+bf(c)$; hence $\limsup_{n→\infty}f(n)/n=\max_{0≤a\lt c}\limsup_{b→\infty}f(a+bc)/(a+bc)≤f(c)/c$ for all <em>c</em>; hence $\limsup_{n→\infty}f(n)/n≤\liminf_{n→\infty}f(n)/n$).

It is not difficult to show that the multiplicative factor for just two block sizes, 1 and <em>b</em>, is $2-1/b$; hence $N(3)\ge1\frac23$.

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02c.html#ch02ex_1_5_40" id="ch02ex_1_5_40a">40</a>. Robson has proved that $N(2^r)≤1+r$, by using the following strategy: Allocate to each block of size <em>k</em>, where $2^m≤k\lt2^{m+1}$, the first available block of <em>k</em> locations starting at a multiple of $2^m$.</p>

  <p class="indent">Let $N(\{b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n\})$ denote the multiplicative factor when all block sizes are constrained to lie in the set $\{b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n\}$, so that $N(n)=N(\{1,2,\ldots,n\})$. Robson and S. Krogdahl have discovered that $N(\{b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n\})=n-(b_1/b_2+\cdots+b_{n-1}/b_n)$ whenever $b_i$ is a multiple of $b_{i-1}$ for $1\lt i≤n$; indeed, Robson has established the <em>exact</em> formula $N(2^rm,\{1,2,4,\ldots,2^r\})=2^rm(1+\frac12r)-2^r+1$. Thus in particular, $N(n)\ge1+\frac12\lfloor\lg n\lfloor$. He also has derived the upper bound $N(n)≤1.1825\ln n+O(1)$, and he conjectures tentatively that $N(n)=H_n$. This conjecture would follow if $N(\{b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_n\})$ were equal to $n-(b_1/b_2+\cdots+b_{n-1}/b_n)$ in general, but this is unfortunately not the case since Robson has proved that $N(\{3,4\})\ge1\frac4{15}$.

  <p><a id="page_617"></a><a href="../Text/ch02c.html#ch02ex_1_5_41" id="ch02ex_1_5_41a">41</a>. Consider maintaining the blocks of size $2^k$: The requests for sizes $1,2,4,\ldots,2^{k-1}$ will periodically call for a new block of size $2^k$ to be split, or a block of that size will be returned. We can prove by induction on <em>k</em> that the total storage consumed by such split blocks never exceeds $kn$; for after every request to split a block of size $2^{k+1}$, we are using at most $kn$ locations in split $2^k\unicode{45}\rm blocks$ and at most <em>n</em> locations in unsplit ones.</p>

  <p class="indent">This argument can be strengthened to show that $a_rn$ cells suffice, where $a_0=1$ and $a_k=1+a_{k-1}(1-2^{-k})$; we have</p>

  <div class="image"><img src="../Images/e617_01.png" /></div>

  <p>Conversely for $r≤5$ it can be shown that a buddy system sometimes <em>requires</em> as many as $a_rn$ cells, if the mechanism of steps R1 and R2 is modified to choose the worst possible available $2^j\unicode{45}\rm block$ to split instead of the first such block.</p>

  <p class="indent">Robson’s proof that $N(2^r)≤1+r$ (see <a href="../Text/ch02c.html#ch02ex_1_5_40">exercise 40</a>) is easily modified to show that such a “leftmost” strategy will never need more than $\left(1+\frac12r\right)n$ cells to allocate space for blocks of sizes $1,2,4,\ldots,2^r$, since blocks of size $2^k$ will never be placed in locations $\ge\left(1+\frac12k\right)$. Although his algorithm seems very much like the buddy system, it turns out that no buddy system will be this good, even if we modify steps R1 and R2 to choose the best possible available $2^j\unicode{45}\rm block$ to split. For example, consider the following sequence of “snapshots” of the memory, for $n=16$ and $r=3$:</p>

  <div class="image"><img src="../Images/e617_04.png" /></div>

  <p>Here 0 denotes an available location and <em>k</em> denotes the beginning of a <em>k</em>-block. In a similar way there is a sequence of operations, whenever <em>n</em> is a multiple of 16, that forces $\frac{3}{16}n$ blocks of size 8 to be $\frac18$ full, and another $\frac{1}{16}n$ to be $\frac12$ full. If <em>n</em> is a multiple of 128, a subsequent request for $\frac{9}{128}n$ blocks of size 8 will require more than $2.5n$ memory cells. (The buddy system allows unwanted 1s to creep into $\frac{3}{16}n$ of the 8-blocks, since there are no other available 2s to be split at a crucial time; the “leftmost” algorithm keeps all 1s confined.)</p>

  <p><a href="../Text/ch02c.html#ch02ex_1_5_42" id="ch02ex_1_5_42a">42</a>. We can assume that $m\ge6$. The main idea is to establish the occupancy pattern $R_{m-2}(F_{m-3}R_1)^k$ at the beginning of the memory, for $k=0,1,\ldots$, where $R_j$ and $F_j$ denote reserved and free blocks of size <em>j</em>. The transition from <em>k</em> to $k+1$ begins with</p>

  <p>then the commutation sequence $F_{m-3}R_1F_mR_{m-5}R_1→F_{m-3}R_1R_{m-2}R_2R_{m-5}R_1→$ $F_{2m-4}R_2R_{m-5}R_1→R_mR_{m-5}R_1R_2R_{m-5}R_1→$ $F_mR_{m-5}R_1F_{m-3}R_1$ is used <em>k</em> times until we get $F_mR_{m-5}R_1(F_{m-3}R_1)^k→F_{2m-5}R_1(F_{m-3}R_1)^k→R_{m-2}(F_{m-3}R_1)^{k+1}$. Finally, when <em>k</em> gets large enough, there is an endgame that forces overflow unless the memory size is at least $(n-4m+11)(m-2)$; details appear in <em>Comp. J.</em> <strong>20</strong> (1977), <a id="page_618"></a>242–244. [Notice that the worst conceivable worst case, which begins with the pattern $F_{m-1}R_1F_{m-1}R_1F_{m-1}R_1\ldots$, is only slightly worse than this; the next-fit strategy of <a href="../Text/ch02c.html#ch02ex_1_5_6">exercise 6</a> can produce this pessimal pattern.]</p>

  <div class="image"><img src="../Images/e618_01.png" /></div>

  <p>the constant sequence $D_m=1/\ln2$ satisfies the necessary conditions. The proof is by induction on <em>m</em>. Let $N_j=nC_j$ for $j\ge1$, and suppose that some request for a block of size <em>m</em> cannot be allocated in the leftmost $N_m$ cells of memory. Then $m\gt1$. For $0≤j\lt m$, we let $N'_j$ denote the rightmost position allocated to blocks of sizes $≤j$, or 0 if all reserved blocks are larger than <em>j</em>; by induction we have $N'_j≤N_j$. Furthermore we let $N'_m$ be the rightmost occupied position $≤N_m$, so that $N'_m\ge N_m-m+1$. Then the interval $\left(N'_{j-1}..N'_j\right]$ contains at least $\left\lceil j(N'_j-N'_{j-1})/(m+j-1)\right\rceil$ occupied cells, since its free blocks are of size $\lt m$ and its reserved blocks are of size $\ge j$. It follows that $n-m\ge$ number of occupied cells ≥ $∑_{j=1}^mj(N'_j-N'_{j-1})/(m+j-1)=mN'_m/(2m-1)-(m-1)$ $∑_{j=1}^{m-1}N'_j/(m+j)(m+j-1)\gt$ $mN_m/(2m-1)-m-(m-1)$ $∑_{j=1}^{m-1}N_j(1/(m+j-1)-1/(m+j))=$ $∑_{j=1}^mnD_j/(m+j-1)-m\ge n-m$, a contradiction.</p>
